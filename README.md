# Google Calendar Event Notifier

This project consists of three Python scripts: `google-calendar-requests.py`, `google-calendar-webbrowser.py`, and `google-calendar-systray.py`. Together, they monitor upcoming events from your Google Calendar and automatically open Google Meet links for events starting within one minute.

## Overview of Scripts

### 1. google-calendar-requests.py
- Connects to the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.
- Saves the event data in a JSON file (`events.json`).

### 2. google-calendar-webbrowser.py
- Loads event data from `events.json`.
- Checks if any event starts within the next minute.
- Automatically opens the corresponding Google Meet link in the default web browser.

### 3. google-calendar-systray.py
- Runs in the system tray for easy access.
- Monitors upcoming events from `events.json`.
- Automatically opens Google Meet links for events starting within one minute.
- Provides a manual refresh option to update events by running the `google-calendar-requests.py` script.

## Prerequisites

Before running these scripts, ensure you have:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- The required libraries installed:

   ```bash
   pip install pystray Pillow google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client
   ```

## Setup Instructions

### Set Up Google Calendar API:
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project and enable the Google Calendar API.
3. Create credentials (OAuth 2.0 Client IDs) and download the JSON file.
4. Rename this file to `credentials.json` and place it in the same directory as your scripts.

### Generate events.json:
Run the `google-calendar-requests.py` script to generate the `events.json` file containing your upcoming events:

```bash
python google-calendar-requests.py
```

### Run the Web Browser Script:
To run the web browser version, execute:

```bash
python google-calendar-webbrowser.py
```

### Run the System Tray Script:
To run the system tray version, execute:

```bash
python google-calendar-systray.py
```

## System Tray Icon:
The system tray script will run in your system tray. You can right-click on the icon to access options to refresh events or quit the application.

## Automatic Link Opening:
Both scripts will check for any events starting within one minute and will automatically open their Google Meet links in your default web browser.

## Notes
- All scripts assume that the `events.json` file is located in the same directory as these scripts.
- Ensure that your system's default web browser is set correctly, as this is where meeting links will be opened.
- You may need to adjust the path for your icon image (`appIco.png`) in `google-calendar-systray.py` based on its location.

## Example Output
When an event is about to start, you will see output similar to:

```
Opening meeting link: https://meet.google.com/example
```

When refreshing events in the system tray version, you will see:

```
Refreshing events...
```
